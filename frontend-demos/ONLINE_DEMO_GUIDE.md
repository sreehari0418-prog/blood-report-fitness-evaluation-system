# 🌐 How to Demonstrate Code Online

If you want to show the **Code ➔ Run ➔ Interface** workflow using an online browser tool, here is the best way to do it.

## 1. Get Your Code Ready 📋
I have created a special folder for you called `source-code-for-copying`.
Inside, you will find `.txt` versions of all your demos.

1. Open the folder: `blood report fitness evaluation system/frontend-demos/source-code-for-copying`
2. Open any file (e.g., `01-login-demo.txt`) with a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit).
3. Press **Cmd+A** (Select All) and then **Cmd+C** (Copy).

## 2. Choose an Online Runner 🚀

Here are the best free websites to paste your code and run it live:

### A. W3Schools TryIt Editor (Recommended for Beginners)
*   **Website:** [https://www.w3schools.com/tryit/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_hello](https://www.w3schools.com/tryit/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_hello)
*   **How to use:**
    1.  Delete everything on the left side.
    2.  **Paste** your code.
    3.  Click the green **Run** button at the top.
    4.  The interface appears on the right!

### B. PlayCode (Fast & Modern)
*   **Website:** [https://playcode.io/new](https://playcode.io/new)
*   **How to use:**

    2.  In the `index.html` file, delete everything.
    3.  **Paste** your code.
    4.  You will see the result immediately on the right side (Live Preview).

### C. JSBin (Simple & Clean)
*   **Website:** [https://jsbin.com/?html,output](https://jsbin.com/?html,output)

    2.  Delete existing code in the HTML column.
    3.  **Paste** your code.
    4.  The result appears instantly in the Output column.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Presentation

1.  **Open the text file first:** Have the code ready to copy before you start sharing your screen.
2.  **Zoom In:** Press `Cmd +` in your browser so the code text is large and readable for the teachers.
3.  **Explain as you paste:** "Here is the frontend code for the Login module..." -> *Paste* -> "Now I click Run..." -> *Click* -> "And here is the interactive interface."

## ⚠️ Important Note
Since our demo files contain HTML, CSS (`<style>`), and JavaScript (`<script>`) all in one file, you should always paste the **entire code** into the validation/HTML section of these tools. You do NOT need to separate them into different boxes.
